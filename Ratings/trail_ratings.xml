            Trail is occasionally narrow and/or poorly defined. Portions are rough and might entail navigating deadfall and/or hopping over rocks. Some junctions might not be marked and trail might fade in the alpine with infrequent flagging.

            Rough and sometimes very steep trail that frequently dissapears necessitating route-finding. Junctions are often not flagged. Possibility of scramble steps up gullies or rock bluffs, but not harder than class 2

            Exploratory, off-trail trip reserved only for seasoned explorers. Flags and/or cairns are generally not present. Unbridged stream crossings and heavy bushwhack. Possibility of difficult scrambling (class 3 or above) that might require a rope.
